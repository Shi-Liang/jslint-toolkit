    <br />
    You may use any JSLint-Toolkit project under the terms of either the MIT License or the
    GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.
    <br />
    <br />
    The MIT License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to understand
    and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with a JSLint-Toolkit project.
    <br />
    <br />
    If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use a JSLint-Toolkit project
    under that license.
    <br />
    <br />
    You don’t have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you
    don’t have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use a JSLint-Toolkit
    project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.
